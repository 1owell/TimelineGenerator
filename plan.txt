Initial Requirements:

- Be able to log 'events' with starting and ending dates (could be days, months, or years). 
- Converts data to csv format for download.
- Clean UI that presents data in an attractive way, and allows elements to be clicked, manipulated, etc.
- Color coordination
- 'Zoom' in and out on the timeline
- Initial page prompts user for name of timeline, a description, a start date and optional end date. 
- Needs to store session data client side so work isn't lost if page is reloaded. 
- Use SVG to generate timeline

Components:

- Events
- Timeline?
- Button
- Input fields > text boxes
-

Dumb componets are like views
Smart components are like controllers

svg will be the basis of the timeline ui. I can create a line, events, etc with svg, easily change colors and js events.
